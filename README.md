This is my chat application!
I built it with Express server connected to database in MongoDB.
Tech stack: MERN + Socket.io + TailwindCSS + Daisy UI
Authentication && Authorization with JWT
Real-time messaging with Socket.io
Online user status (Socket.io and React Context)
Global state management with Zustand
Error handling both on the server and on the client
